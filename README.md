Linear Regression Program
Description

This program implements a simple linear regression model to estimate the price of a car based on its mileage. It uses gradient descent to adjust model parameters and minimize the cost function.
Features

    Price Prediction: The program allows predicting the price of a car based on user-provided mileage.
    Model Training: It can also be used to train the model on an existing dataset, adjusting model parameters to fit the training data.

How to Use

    Model Training:
        Run the program using python train_model.py.
        The model will be trained on the data, and adjusted parameters will be saved in the thetas.csv file.

    Price Prediction:
        Ensure the model is already trained by following the previous step.
        Run the program using python EstimatePrice.py.
        Enter a mileage when prompted, and the program will provide an estimated price.

Dependencies

    Python 3.x
    Python Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib

Feel free to explore and experiment with the code to gain a better understanding of the linear regression process and its application in predicting car prices.
